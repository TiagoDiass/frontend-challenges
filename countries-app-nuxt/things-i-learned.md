## Things that I learned by developing this project

- How to define props and emits in Vue 3 + Typescript (`defineProps` and `defineEmits`).
- Settings to make a route static and others client-side-rendered or server side rendered.
- How to define state in Vue 3 TS (`useState`).
- Server routes to create a kind of BFF.
- Tailwind CSS.
